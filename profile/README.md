## Best practice for organisation members

If youre new here please read the TwinsUK github intro.

Ensuring against disclosure is of utmost importance to us. If you're not familiar with using git or github, we've set up some template repositories which you can use to initialise your project. These have branch protection and .gitignore files ready set to help you ensure youre only sharing what you mean to. These include a script to purge your repo incase of accidental disclosure. 

**We recommend all projects should be initialised as private until disclosure control checks have been run** 

They can be viewed by members of TwinsUK who you invite to collaborate when set to private.

## Data Privacy & Access

TwinsUK handles sensitive health and genomic data. Please note:

- No raw participant data is stored in this GitHub organisation
- Sharing of data or results must follow ethical approvals and data governance policies
